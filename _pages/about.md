* I’m a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Humanities and Social Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.
* I'm very lucky to have Prof. [Tang Wenfang](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/teacher/742) as my supervisor.
* I'm also very lucky to work as research assistant under the supervision of Prof. [Xia Ying](https://sog.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/XiaYing) during 2021-2023.
* My research interests lie in the general areas of computational social science, public opinion and social epigenetics. 
* I worked as a Senior Algorithm Engineer at [Mininglamp Technology](https://www.mininglamp.com/) during 2021-2023. My work focused mainly on deep learning, natural language processing, and Large Language models.
* I’m a signed photographer with [Visual China Group (VCG)](https://www.vcg.com/), passionately capturing the harmony between nature’s grandeur and architectural elegance.
* I don’t use social media such as Twitter, Facebook, or Weibo, although I may have registered accounts on these platforms before for research purposes.
* [Here](https://andrewlamcuhk.github.io/) is my blog.
