* I'm a second-year Ph.D student in the School of Humanities and Social Science of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.
* I'm very lucky to have Prof. [Tang Wenfang](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/teacher/742) be my supervisor.
* I'm also very lucky to worked as research assistant under the supervise of Prof. [XIA Ying](https://sog.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/XiaYing) during 2021-2023.
* My research interests lie in the general area of Computational Social Science and Public Opinions. 
* I worked as a Senior Algorithm Engineer in [Mininglamp Technology](https://www.mininglamp.com/) during 2021-2023. My field of work is mainly deep learning, Natural Language Processing and Large Language Model.
* I’m a signed photographer with [Visual China Group (VCG)](https://www.vcg.com/), passionately capturing the harmony between nature’s grandeur and architectural elegance.
* I don't use social media like Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, even though I might have accidentally registered them for research purpose before.
